Port of Camera Patch Lite plugin to PSP Go

Camera Patch Lite plugin belongs to freakler which is based on DS3Remapper plugin by Total_Noob. Freakler has extended it and added per game configurations, now i am porting it back to PSP Go for use with a Dualshock 3.

Enable it as a GAME plugin and enjoy. It will disable the PSP input pad so make sure your Dualshock 3 is connected. I will add Dualshock 3 detection and enable the plugin only when a Dualshock 3 is connected later.
